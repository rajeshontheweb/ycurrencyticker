My first project on google codes, trying to get a currency ticker (first) that can display bullion rates as well..

Current Features:
> Displays a small ticker on the desktop showing a currency's value against another one.
> Supports 12 Currencies : AUD, BDT, GBP, CAD, EUR, HKD, INR, JPY, NPR, LKR, CHF
> Bullion rates not available yet, will work on it sooner or later.
> Shows a system tray tip every time it is updated.
